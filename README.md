## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Navigate to [my github repository](https://github.com/kimmykokonut/quiz-of-choice) for this project 

2. Click the `Fork` button and  you will be taken to a new page where you can give your repository a new name and description. Choose "create fork".

3. Click the `Code` button and copy the url for HTTPS.

4. On your local computer, create a working directory for my files and name appropriately.

5. On your terminal, type `$ git clone 'url'` (using the url from step 3.)

6. On your terminal, type `$ code .` to open in VS Code.  If you do not have VS Code Editor, you may download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

7. Once in VS Code, open the terminal there and type 
`$ npm install` (to install the packages and dependencies). 
You may also need to install bootstrap and uuid with these terminal commands: `$ npm install bootstrap`, 
`$ npm install uuid`

8.  Now you can access my code. 
* To launch the dev server, run `$ npm run start`
* To build the project for production, run `$ npm run build`

Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
